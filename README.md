# Cloud Native BPF Workshop

This workshop will demonstrate how to use eBPF tools inside Kubernetes.

It's strongly recommended to have all requirements installed and ready to
use before starting the workshop. This could be on your own computer or on
a virtual machine that you have access to.

## Minikube requirements

To try out the exercises of this workshop, you'll need to run a version of
Minikube with a few additional patches to get access to the kernel headers.
Please read [minikube.md](./minikube.md) for instructions.

## kubectl requirements

Please make sure that the machine you're using has kubectl installed. You
can refer to [this
page](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl/) for
installation instructions.

## Inspektor Gadget requirements

During the workshop, we'll use release
[v0.2.0](https://github.com/kinvolk/inspektor-gadget/releases/tag/v0.2.0)
of Inspektor Gadget for all examples. Please follow the [installation
instructions](https://github.com/kinvolk/inspektor-gadget/blob/master/Documentation/install.md),
to have this ready.

## kubectl-trace requirements

During the workshop, we'll also use kubectl-trace. Please follow the
[installation
instructions](https://github.com/iovisor/kubectl-trace#installing) for
installing the plugin on your computer.

kubectl-trace is a client-side plugin but it starts pods in the Kubernetes cluster named "trace-runner".
We needed changes on the trace-runner pod. We'll use a version of kubectl-trace with
patches that haven't been released yet, so that it can work inside Minikube.
In particular, we'll use this kubectl-trace branch
[alban/ikheaders](https://github.com/kinvolk/kubectl-trace/tree/alban/ikheaders)
that includes the following patch:
- https://github.com/iovisor/kubectl-trace/pull/123 - add xz-utils to the
  container image

For convenience, there is a build with container images available on Docker registries.
```
$ kubectl trace run \
    --imagename "docker.io/albanc/kubectl-trace-bpftrace:e896345e3d8f80aa968422c6199ac5180d688f65" \
    --init-imagename "docker.io/albanc/kubectl-trace-init:e896345e3d8f80aa968422c6199ac5180d688f65" \
    minikube -e "tracepoint:syscalls:sys_enter_* { @[probe] = count(); }"
$ kubectl trace get
$ kubectl trace attach kubectl-trace-a05bde1e-c44a-11ea-b314-c85b763781a4
```

It was built with the following commands
```
$ export IMAGE_NAME_INIT=docker.io/albanc/kubectl-trace-init
$ export IMAGE_NAME=docker.io/albanc/kubectl-trace-bpftrace
$ make build
$ make build image/build-init image/build
$ make image/push
```

# Workshop Material

During the workshop, we will cover the basics of BPF and we will go through
the exercises listed here, in order.

You can refer to the [slides](slides.pdf) at any time.
